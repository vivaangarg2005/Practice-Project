📏 Unit Converter

This is a simple and responsive **Unit Converter** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It allows users to convert values between different units of length such as kilometers, meters, inches, feet, miles, and more — with real-time two-way conversion.

💡 How to Use

1. Enter a number in either of the input boxes.  
2. Select the **source unit** from the dropdown next to the first box.  
3. Select the **target unit** from the dropdown next to the second box.  
4. The other box will instantly show the converted value.  
5. Works in both directions — input in either field will auto-convert to the other.
